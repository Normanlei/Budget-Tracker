# Budget-Tracker

## Description

Imagining how awesome it would be if having a handy budget tracker application, so you can keep track of what you have expensed and deposited. In this project, I have built a budget tracker application that enable user to add expenses and deposits along with details, especially with or without a connection. In other words, when entering transactions offline, they will populate all transactions that entered offline when brought back online.

Here is how the application made of:
* UI: **HTML** & **CSS**
* Database: **MONGO** & **MONGOOSE SCHEMA** & **IndexDB**
* Backend: **Node**, **Express** , **MANIFEST** & **SERVICE WORKER** & **Webpack**

## Development

In the process of building application, I have learned:
* Utilize Github repository, familiarize git commands to save all my works onto github

* Familiarize the basic html commands to build the full contents of the site

* Utilize manifest feature to make it compatitible for mobile

* Utilize service worker as cach to make the application working even when it is offline

* Utilize Webpack JS module bundler along with plugin feature of Manifest and Service Worker

* Add extra features of category so user can categorize their transactions and be able to view them seperately
